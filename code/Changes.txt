calculateBelonging.m
	1. Create the whole matrix B at the start
		Reason: Simulink does not support variables with changing size
	2. Changed how the values b are added  to Matrix B
		Reason: Simulink does not support variables with changing size
	3. Changed the name of the input variable T to MFin (T = triangle, MFin = membership function)
		Reason: Just thought it would be a better name.

applyRules.m
	1. Added the output membership functions as a input MFout
		Reason: The amount of output functions is required for declaring the matrix Bout at the start
	2. Changed how the size of Bout is calculated
		Reason: The size of Bout was calculated using max functions and simulink does not support variables with no upper bound


defuzzify.m
	1. Declared A, c, Ao and co at the start
		Reason: Simulink does not support variables with changing size
	2. Function caac was called incorrectly at line 9 (input arguments were in were swapped)
		Reason: Correcting a stupid mistake

caac.m
	1. Declared a, b, c, d, ll, el, er and lr at the start
		Reason: Variables were used inside "if" clause and caused error in simulink
	2. Added special case if the belonging B is 0.
		Reason: Returned NaN (not a number) on test.

overlap.m
	1. Declared a, b, c, d, ll, el, er and lr at the start
		Reason: Variables were used inside "if" clause and caused error in simulink
	2. Added special case if min(h1, h2) is 0.
		Reason: Returned NaN (not a number) on test.
